# Account Setup Devlog

Devlog of account setup actions. Granular details deferred to other docs.

## Overview

Got three accounts setup: Cloudflare, Clio, and Teams. Cloudflare was straightforward—Worker, DO, D1, R2, Vectorize, and AI were all configured, bound to the worker, accessible from local and remote servers, and tests were created for them. Clio was also easy and the auth endpoint is working. Costs ~$50/month to keep a Clio developer account. Teams was more confusing. We initially planned on using developer accounts but that wasn't financially feasible. We pivoted to using Agents Playground for initial setup and validation, deferring a real Teams tenant to Phase 10 for end-to-end testing. The Agents Playground runs locally, connects to our Worker, and simulates a Teams chatbot—covering all development needs.

## Step 1: Cloudflare Setup

### 1.1 Created Worker Project

Followed all steps in <https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/> Step 1. Create a Worker project:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- durable-object-starter
```

### 1.2 Installed Wrangler CLI

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
```

### 1.3 Created D1 Database

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create docket-db
# database_id: afb86a9d-5697-401d-b55a-6079a7aa8779
```

```jsonc
"d1_databases": [
  {
    "binding": "docket_db",
    "database_name": "docket-db",
    "database_id": "afb86a9d-5697-401d-b55a-6079a7aa8779"
  }
]
```

**Local vs Remote:** Use `wrangler dev` (local) by default. Use `--remote` only for production debugging.

### 1.4 Created R2 Bucket

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create docket-storage
```

```jsonc
"r2_buckets": [
  {
    "bucket_name": "docket-storage",
    "binding": "docket_storage"
  }
]
```

### 1.5 Created Vectorize Index

```bash
npx wrangler vectorize create docket-vectors --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine
```

```jsonc
"vectorize": [
  {
    "binding": "VECTORIZE",
    "index_name": "docket-vectors"
  }
]
```

### 1.6 Added Workers AI

```jsonc
"ai": {
  "binding": "AI"
}
```

### 1.7 Configured Durable Objects

```jsonc
"durable_objects": {
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "TENANT",
      "class_name": "TenantDO"
    }
  ]
},
"migrations": [
  {
    "tag": "v1",
    "new_sqlite_classes": ["TenantDO"]
  }
]
```

### 1.8 Enabled Observability

```jsonc
"observability": {
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Step 2: Clio Setup

### 2.1 Created Developer App

You need a paid Clio account to create applications. EasyStart tier doesn't support developer features.

<https://developers.clio.com/> → New App

```text
Name: Docket
URL: https://docketadmin.com
Redirect URI: http://127.0.0.1:8787/callback
Permissions: Everything except Clio Payments
```

### 2.2 Stored Production Secrets

```bash
npx wrangler secret put CLIO_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put CLIO_APP_ID
```

### 2.3 Created Local Environment

Created `.dev.vars` (gitignored):

```env
CLIO_APP_ID=app_id
CLIO_CLIENT_ID=client_id
CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET=client_secret
```

### 2.4 OAuth Flow Reference

```text
1. User clicks "Connect Clio"
2. Redirect to: https://app.clio.com/oauth/authorize?
     response_type=code&client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&state=...
3. User approves access
4. Clio redirects to callback with auth code
5. Exchange code for tokens via POST https://app.clio.com/oauth/token
6. Receive access_token, refresh_token (expires in 7 days)
```

## Step 3: Microsoft Teams Setup

Two environments for bot testing: M365 Agents Playground (free, no tenant) and Business Basic Tenant (deferred to Phase 10).

See `docs/02-account-setup/01-teams-development-workflow.md` for environment details.

### 3.1 Installed M365 Agents Playground

Bash installation:

```bash
npm install -g @microsoft/m365agentsplayground
```

### 3.2 Deferred: Business Basic Tenant

Full E2E testing with real Teams tenant deferred to Phase 10. Can purchase earlier if needed.

## Step 4: Verification Tests

### 4.1 Set Up Cloudflare Environment Tests

In `src/index.ts` and `test/index.spec.ts` I set up tests for interacting with DOs, D1, R2, and Vectorize + AI. All tests ran locally (except Vectorize + AI which don't work locally), remotely, and from the deployed Cloudflare Worker.

### 4.2 Tested Clio OAuth

Authorization code received. OAuth flow working:

1. Opened: `https://app.clio.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIO_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:8787/callback&state=test123`
2. Approved permissions on Clio "Approve/Deny Permissions" screen
3. Redirected to: `http://127.0.0.1:8787/callback?code=HEKQCpWAjKE5UtHfbZL8&state=test123`

### 4.3 Tested Agents Playground

Bot message handling working via M365 Agents Playground. Bot Framework requires POSTing replies back to `serviceUrl`, not returning them in the response body.

1. Added `/api/messages` endpoint to worker (Bot Framework Activity protocol)
2. Launched: `npx @microsoft/m365agentsplayground -e "http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/messages" -c "emulator"`
3. Sent messages in playground UI, bot replies appear correctly
