**Note:** Shared KB content (Clio workflows, deadline calculations, billing guidance) requires legal expert review. Use placeholder content if unavailable.

## Phase 6: Core Worker + Durable Object

**Checklist:**

- [x] DO bindings configured in `wrangler.jsonc`
- [x] One DO per organization (DO ID = org identity)
- [x] DO derives `orgId` from DO ID, rejects mismatched `ChannelMessage.orgId`
- [x] Constructor uses `blockConcurrencyWhile()` for migrations + schema loading
- [x] `PRAGMA user_version` for DO SQLite migration tracking
- [x] DO SQLite tables (conversations, messages, pending_confirmations, org_settings, clio_schema_cache)
- [x] `ChannelMessage` interface (channel, orgId, userId, userRole, conversationId, conversationScope, message, jurisdictions[], practiceTypes[], firmSize, metadata)
- [x] `POST /process-message` endpoint
- [x] Channel Adapter routing (unified format)
- [x] ChannelMessage validation
- [x] Workspace binding validation (D1 lookup)
- [x] Conversation isolation per `conversationId`
- [x] Permission enforcement in DO (role check before LLM, log unauthorized attempts)
- [x] Generic error responses ("I'm having trouble processing your request")
- [x] Audit logging to R2 (CUD operations, Org Context changes, role changes, Clio OAuth events)
- [x] User leaves org: `POST /remove-user` expires `pending_confirmations` in DO
- [x] Org deletion: Worker calls `POST /delete-org` on DO to clear SQLite + KV storage
- [x] GDPR: `POST /purge-user-data` purges user's conversations/messages from DO
- [x] Unit tests passing (TenantDO tests written but skipped - DO SQLite blocked by vitest-pool-workers SQLITE_AUTH)
- [x] Integration tests passing
- [x] Demo endpoint (skipped - not blocking)

**Phase 8 Dependencies (deferred):**

- [ ] Clio-specific error responses (401 expired, 429 rate limit, connection errors)
- [ ] User leaves org: delete Clio token from DO KV Storage

**Note:** Clio token storage doesn't exist until Phase 8. Generic error handling covers LLM/RAG failures; Clio-specific errors require Phase 8's OAuth and API integration.

## Phase 7: Workers AI + RAG

**Checklist:**

- [x] Workers AI binding configured
- [x] LLM inference (`@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`)

- [x] System prompt construction (KB context, Org Context, Clio Schema, last 15 messages)
- [x] Context window management (~10K tokens of 128K)
- [x] Single `clioQuery` tool (structured params, DO builds validated Clio calls)
- [x] CUD confirmation flow (pending_confirmations, 5-min expiry)
- [x] Confirmation classification (approve/reject/modify/unrelated)
- [x] Error code handling (3040, 3043 → retry once; 3036 → fail; 5007 → log)
- [x] Graceful degradation (RAG failure → empty context, continue)
- [x] Unit tests passing
- [x] Integration tests passing (RAG integration; DO SQLite tests blocked by vitest-pool-workers)
- [x] Demo endpoint deployed

## Phase 8: Clio Integration

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Clio OAuth flow (PKCE S256, state signed with HMAC-SHA256, 10-min expiry)
- [ ] Token storage in DO Storage (AES-GCM encrypted, per-user key derivation)

- [ ] Clio connect flow (OAuth redirect)
- [ ] Clio schema refresh button (Admin only)
- [ ] Org Context upload UI (MIME validation, 25MB limit, filename sanitization)
- [ ] Org Context management (list, delete)
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Demo deployed

**Note:** Required before Teams adapter (OAuth redirects, signup, Org Context upload).

- [ ] "No account found" response for unmatched emails
- [ ] Validate workspace linked to user's org for groupChat/teams
